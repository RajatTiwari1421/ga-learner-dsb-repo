### Project Overview

 In this project, I have created a Student Management System to manage the Student's records for University of Data Science.
Such as,
1)Prepare the Student Roster.
2)Generate progress report of Students.
3)Calculating the Maximum marks scored in the class in Mathematics.
4)Scholarship Certificate.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how to code a programme by applying the following concepts,
1)Mathematical Operations
2)List Operations
3)Dictionary Operations
4)String indexing and formatting



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I followed the steps that have been provided by the GreyAtom study materials to solve the programme.
1) Like  how to create a Class using List function.
2)How to define a Dictionary in Python and calculate the total marks and percentage fron available data.
3)How to calculate maximum marks scored in Mathematics using 'max() function' from Dictionary.
4)To create Scholarship Certificate using String function.


### Challenges faced

 I faced basic challenges like,
1)Spliting the fullname using concatenation
2)Applying the upper function to convert lowercase string into uppercase string
3)Calulating of maximum marks using max() function
